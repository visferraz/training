    <h2> BlueBird - Charles Bukowski</h2>
    <h3>
        There's a bluebird in my heart that<br />
Wants to get out but I'm too tough for him<br />
I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br />
To let anybody see you<br />
There's a bluebird in my heart that<br />
Wants to get out<br />
But I pour whiskey on him and inhale<br />
Cigarette smoke<br />
And the whores and the bartenders<br />
And the grocery clerks never know that<br />
He's in there<br />
There's a bluebird in my heart that<br />
Wants to get out but I'm too tough for him<br />
I say, Stay down, do you want to mess<br />
Me up? You want to screw up the<br />
Works? You want to blow my book sales in<br />
Europe? There's a bluebird in my heart that<br />
Wants to get out<br />
But I'm too clever, I only let him out<br />
At night sometimes when everybody's asleep<br />
I say, I know that you're there<br />
So don't be sad<br />
Then I put him back<br />
But he's singing a little<br />
In there, I haven't quite let him die<br />
And we sleep together like that<br />
With our secret pact<br />
And it's nice enough to make a man<br />
Weep, but I don't weep, do<br />
You?
